# 📉 Machine Learning Models for Stock Price Patterns, Volatility Surfaces & Macroeconomic Indicators

This project applies machine learning algorithms to financial and economic data to model:

- 📈 **Stock Price Patterns** – trend detection, price movement prediction
- 🌫️ **Volatility Surfaces** – option-implied volatility estimation
- 📊 **Macroeconomic Indicators** – GDP, inflation, interest rate forecasting

The repository includes modular pipelines for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization—optimized for interpretability and scalability.
